The implemenetation contains two parts, the sender and the reciever. The sender
Depends on a set of already generated keys from the reciever, so it checks to see
if the proper file has been created. If not, prompt the user to generate it. If the key
exists, the sender then generates its own keys and then gets text from the user.
After getting text, it encrypts the message with a shared AES key, in this case the string
'Sixteen byte key'. Once the text is properly encrypted and the hash is generated, this is all
written to encrypted.txt. Then, the user can run reciever.py, which then reads this file,
parses it, and decrypts the proper data points. The reciever then shows the user what has been sent.
